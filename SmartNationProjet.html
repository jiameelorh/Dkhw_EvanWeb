							During our first class, we were introduced to many different sensor technologies that are compatible with the PI, I found it interesting how we can do many things through this small device alone.
							<br><br>
							As we started to connect the light bulb, buttons and LCD panel to the PI, we made many mistakes like placing the button in the wrong direction and connecting the wire at the wrong hole. This made my partner and I really frustrated as we couldn't get the desired results. But through the guidance of my teacher, I was able to better grasp how the whole practical works, thus helping me to understand each component's responsibility in the circuit. Therefore overall I felt this practice was really good and fruitful.

              <strong>Week 2 Lesson 1</strong><br>
              For this lesson we played around with the different PI modules such as the PIR Motion Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor and Smoke sensor.<br>
              While trying out the different sensors, I personally found it frustrating when there were errors, as we were foreign to the codes and hardware. One of the obstacles I face is when we were connecting the MCP chip to the breadboard, we didn’t know we were supposed to connect the chip into the board hence we used the wires to connect it instead. We found it weird that the wire was really lose on the chip. However, after many trials, my teacher eventually showed me how to connect it properly and I was personally dumbfounded.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Week 2 Lesson 2</strong>
              For this lesson, we continued where we left off and connected the temperature and humidity sensor and the NFC Module. As we had made the mistake of not connecting the MCP Chip to the board, I was able to identify that the temperature and humidity sensor needed to be connect to the breadboard for it to work, due the missing component that was not provided. Therefore, connecting the hardware was smooth sailing. However, when we were suppose to run the program I faced many challenges such as some typo in the codes and not being patient enough to let the code run. As the hardware requires some time to get the data, my partner and I panicked for awhile as the program doesn’t show us any data, therefore we had to put print(“Hello world”) to see if our program is even running.
              <br>
              Overall I felt that I have learned a lot about being patient and understanding the how the codes communicates with the hardware.
