							During our first class, we were introduced to many different sensor technologies that are compatible with the PI, I found it interesting how we can do many things through this small device alone.
							<br><br>
							As we started to connect the light bulb, buttons and LCD panel to the PI, we made many mistakes like placing the button in the wrong direction and connecting the wire at the wrong hole. This made my partner and I really frustrated as we couldn't get the desired results. But through the guidance of my teacher, I was able to better grasp how the whole practical works, thus helping me to understand each component's responsibility in the circuit. Therefore overall I felt this practice was really good and fruitful.

              <strong>Week 2 Lesson 1</strong><br>
              For this lesson we played around with the different PI modules such as the PIR Motion Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor and Smoke sensor.<br>
              While trying out the different sensors, I personally found it frustrating when there were errors, as we were foreign to the codes and hardware. One of the obstacles I face is when we were connecting the MCP chip to the breadboard, we didn’t know we were supposed to connect the chip into the board hence we used the wires to connect it instead. We found it weird that the wire was really lose on the chip. However, after many trials, my teacher eventually showed me how to connect it properly and I was personally dumbfounded.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Week 2 Lesson 2</strong>
              For this lesson, we continued where we left off and connected the temperature and humidity sensor and the NFC Module. As we had made the mistake of not connecting the MCP Chip to the board, I was able to identify that the temperature and humidity sensor needed to be connect to the breadboard for it to work, due the missing component that was not provided. Therefore, connecting the hardware was smooth sailing. However, when we were suppose to run the program I faced many challenges such as some typo in the codes and not being patient enough to let the code run. As the hardware requires some time to get the data, my partner and I panicked for awhile as the program doesn’t show us any data, therefore we had to put print(“Hello world”) to see if our program is even running.
              <br>
              Overall I felt that I have learned a lot about being patient and understanding the how the codes communicates with the hardware.

                This lesson has been a familiar one as I have seen and played around with anaconda to do python. Aside from the application, after going through some of the practical I have a better understanding of what python can do practically such as web scraping, sending an email and sending push notification. Also during the practical, I personally have met many challenges such as getting flagged by Gmail, due to the suspicious activity that my email is doing.

						        Week 4's lesson has been easier and interesting, as having to study the python code, I was able to grasp how python can show me real-life data being displayed using Graph, bar and line chart.
                    <br><br>
                    With this practical, it has enabled me to think for ideas for my project too. As my project requires to monitor and display stats constantly, therefore having to learn how to put numbers into visually.
                    <br><br>
                    Machine learning is another area that we touched during class, I personally find it interesting as I manage to have a gist of how python library is able to help me study the patterns and predict the results.
                    <br><br>
                    Through this practice, it has pushed me to study more about machine learning by watching youtube.

              Week 5's lesson was rather interesting, as the school had brought us to Fintech Festival. Upon entering the event, I was personally mesmerized by the sheer size of the event, as they had many booths that were informative and interesting as I was able to see many companies adopting the latest technology into their eco-system.
              <br>
              we visited google cloud, Wallyt, Cove, OneConnect Financial Technology, Tumcreate and open nodes booths. During the visit, we managed to find out more about the technology and I found them interesting as one of them used an old Samsung phone processor to do AI and another detects existing customer by using facial recognition to identify them.
              <br>
              Through this trip, it had give me ideas for the upcoming project and useful information that might be useful to aid in the project.

                Throughout the lesson, I found it useful as this google firebase could potentially help power my smart nation project. Thus leading me to research further on what their capabilities on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kRgVxULbag"> youtube</a>.
