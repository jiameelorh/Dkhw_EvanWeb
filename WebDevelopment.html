        Having the privilege to be a project manager assistant and a web developer, I have gained many valuable experiences such as developing a website and installing a digital wall.
        <br><br>
        During my time in office, I have learned more about myself, as someone passionate about developing a software or website. I have found myself making many careless mistakes such as grammatical error, using of wrong company logo and developing the prototype without knowing the layout requirements. As A*STAR is a well-established company, I have regonized the importance of communicating the message accurately, as a simple spelling mistake would reflect poorly on the company. Therefore I need to have the due diligence to double or triple check my grammar. A few ways I have learned to approach this obstacle is by asking my friends or using 3rd party software to check for my mistakes. Another thing I have learned was that a big company would usually have an established layout for staff to use, for example the colour theme, logo, slide design and website layout. Therefore, I have learned to identify who might be responsible for developing the layout. As this is a big organisation, it might tough to determine who is in charge of certain things. Therefore I could always check with the HQ to help connect me to the right person for the information I needed.
        <br><br>
        Another project that I handled was installing digital signage. I particularly enjoyed doing this project as I felt that it had exposed me to different technologies such as an audio mixer, butterfly network and an HDMI transmitter and receiver. With all this technology that I have learned, it has piqued my interest and pushed me to do a mini project in my room. I have implemented a sound system which allows me to play background music while doing a video conference.

        Overall I felt that I had learned a lot because my supervisor has been proactively teaching me and exposing me to many different things in the office.
