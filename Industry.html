          <p>For this webinar, I found it interesting as it is related to one my elective module that I am currently taking, technopreneurship. The Singapore computer society hosted this webinar, and they invited Mr Chak Kong Soon, Mr Lau Yin Cheng and Jeffrey Nah to share their experiences about being a Technopreneur.</p>
          <img src="img\Blog\Webinar\SCS.png" alt="" class="mw-100">
          <p>
            <br>Through this webinar, I have learned about having the correct mindset, characteristics of a technopreneur, platforms, the process of starting a company and real-life obstacles we need to cross and how to deal with them.
            <br><br>Firstly, to become a technopreneur, we need to learn to take the initiative in whatever we do. One example is that we first must learn to the initiative to find the problem and fill the gap. Through this, we can monetize our solutions as we provide a service. Another example is that in the journey we would have to find people to help us. Hence, we would require us to look for opportunity or partnership proactively. Another trait that a Technopreneur need is to learn to adapt quickly. In their journey, they would have to pivot their ideas to improve the service or product. And with the current technology trend changing ever so often it has made it tougher for us to remain relevant. Therefore, we need to be swift in adapting to the changes to remain competitive.
            <br><br>Secondly, the characteristics of a Technopreneur should have the risk appetite, the desire and swiftness as these traits would provide tools to guide and push us during the journey could be confusing and scary sometimes. It would require us to start with by identifying a problem then we can validate it and finally pivot or evolve the idea as we learn more about the environment and reflect on the issue. The final step in creating a product/ service is that you must source for people who can help you along the journey as you may not be capable and credible enough to convince investors to invest in your idea. Therefore, by having key people in your business, it would significantly boost the confidence of the investors.
            <br><br>During the webinar, they also included a question and answer time which I felt it was quite enriching. As it talks about real life scenarios and practical steps to deal with them. One example is where they shared about doing many mini projects to showcase your skills and be proactive in networking to find potential clients or partner. Another example is that
            <br><br>Overall, Mr Jeffery Nah said something that summarises the whole webinar which is “Technopreneurship can’t be taught but to be caught”. As at first I thought that we would require to learn before applying it, however with this quote it has shifted my paradigm and help me recognize that somethings would require us to try and error. This alone has also pushed me overcome my fears and to actively find projects so that I could gain experience from. A few ways that I have been applying what I have learn is that I have been finding internship during semester break and learning new things through webinars as I started to find more platform that provides free webinar for me to watch.

          <p>
            The reason why I chose this talk was because I felt that it is relevant to the IT industry. Based on my previous semester’s module CSF and Portfolio 1, I felt that by learning the capabilities of 5G, I could grasp how IT would be like in the future. In the talk, it did mention the evolution of communication technology and how it changes the world.
            <br><br>With 5G technology, it has broken the boundary of 4G whereby currently 4G only can connect 5000 devices per square mile as compared to 5G, which can do 5 million per square mile. This could solve problems for the country that has a high-density population. Another example is that 4G has a latency of 10.5ms however, with 5G, it can provide a latency of 1ms. With the data transferring quicker, it would reduce the risk of autonomous vehicles colliding with things or having a hardware error. As when the machine is unable to get the data fast enough it wouldn’t be able to process the data fast enough to react to danger. Another example they provided was the remote robotic arms for doctors to operate on their patients. With data transferred quicker, it would increase the accuracy of the arms. Hence Doctors can have the confidence that the arms can react according to the smallest movement they make. This would help patients that may require doctors from overseas or distant away to provide treatment. Lastly the drone industry would significantly benefit from this upgrade as they are now able to receive stable high definition live video. This will be useful when the drones are being used to send into dangerous places such as defusing bombs, searching for people in crash sites and surveying a protected area.
            <br><br>Hence, I felt that this talk had widened my perspective and made me well informed so that I can be better prepared for what technology could do in the future. Through this TED talk, it also piqued my interest in finding out more of how 5G works. I began to research more about it and found out that they are being connected by five different ways starting with central facilities which represent our houses, servers and routers. Clustered micro antennas which also can be called MIMO, Macro tower which connects data from a long distance and micro antenna which will be found on buildings and street lamps. By understanding the different ways that 5G would be connected it had given me a better understanding of the smart nation initiatives. One such example is that the smart streetlamps can provide a stable connection so that driverless vehicles can get the most reliable connection according to how near they are to the streetlamps.
            <br><br>With the information I have learned, I am also able to think of ideas for different industries such as cybersecurity, whereby you can overwhelm a phone with a lot of information in a short period. This would stop the machine from functioning as they are not able to handle the request. Another idea is by using mixed reality for people to hold their meetings online, this could be a game-changer as it would save time and resources such as office space or auditorium and give the user a similar experience to meeting physically.
