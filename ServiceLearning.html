          <h1>Purpose</h1>
          <p>
            For our project, our target audience is students. We aim to help them understand the fundamentals of scratch so that at the end of the day, the students would leave knowing how to deal and form a complex code. Teaching them how to break it down to smaller bite sizes could help them use it whenever they face complex challenges in life. <br><br>
            For the project, we want to help students learn to manage their emotions better whenever they are stressed. As coding has a steep learning curve, we anticipate that the students might feel stress and have a meltdown. Therefore, we would want to continually remind them not to worry and calm down so that they can better deal with the problem. <br><br>
            Lastly, we also aim to help the students keep up with the teaching materials created by the other groups. We foresee that they might not be familiar with the tutorial, hence by taking some time to go through each tab and layout so that they would better understand what the other groups are teaching.

          <h1>Obstacles</h1>
          <p>
            When my group and I discussed how to develop the video, we had to do video calls as we could not meet each other to do our work. Due to the Covid-19 situation, we had to make use of what we have. As we started on the project, we did not have any idea where we could start, so we decided to create a slide to guide us on producing the content. When we created the introduction and content, it naturally came into us what to we could teach for the next step. When we were year one, we had <br><br>learned the fundamentals of pythons. From there, we took some of the content that we had learned.
            <br><br>As we struggled to keep each other updated with our progress, I have decided to use the teamâ€™s platform and create a clear and standard post to keep track of our progress. My groupmates would also be able to access the different links like the video playlist and website to review and give feedback. However, despite using teams, we eventually moved to use discord as we felt that we could categories our homework hence helping us to identify where are the relevant information.

          <h1>Reflection</h1>
          <p>
            In conclusion, I felt that this service-learning has helped me understand more about myself and learn more about intellectual disabilities, as not all people with ID are necessarily all severe, but they might be mild or moderate. I also learn to be more understanding of them as they may not have the best social skills; hence, they might require people to remind or explain certain social norms.
            <br><br>I had learned more about myself as I could recognize that I could not digest a vast amount of text whenever I read books or assignment requirements. Whenever I read, I would often become confused and I would miss out on crucial details such as submission date or where I should submit. This is evident when the COVID-19 situation came because we are required to attend class online. And with different modules having different ways of submitting the homework, hence I would often <br><br>forget or confuse myself on where I should submit my homework.
            <br><br>Also, I have learned to have better team management as different people might have a different way and pacing of doing things. I was frustrated at first, as I could not push my group mates up to pace. However, after reflection, I realized that some people would perform better under pressure than some. Hence, I would need to continually adjust my expectations and communicate clearly to my group mates about when to do the work.
            <br><br>Lastly, I felt that I had gained an appreciation for volunteer work, as I recognize that the more I volunteer, the more I can see the different walks of life coming together to help the weakest link in the nation. As said that A Chain is as strong as the weakest link, therefore we have to continually lookout for the weak and vulnerable in the society.
