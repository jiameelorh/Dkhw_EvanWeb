            For week 1 we were tasked to select a problem statement from the list that we were given. I have decided to go for "HELP FOR THE AGED AND ELDERLY" problem as I felt that this topic resonated with me the most. When we forming our teams, my lecturer told us to create a mini resume for the leaders to select us. As the leaders would select us based on our skills set, this would ensure fairness in the selection process.
            <br><br>
            When my lecturer announced the grouping I was shocked, as I didn't manage to group with my friends and the majority of them are people who I have not interact with before, hence there was a certain fear in me.
            During the process of selecting the roles, I have opted to be the backend developer as I felt that my strength has been in programming. From there we allocated the roles according to the interest and strength.

          <p>
            Week 2 we learned about conflict management style orientation, whereby we learn more about ourselves and how do we deal with conflict. I think this was useful as I was able to see the team dynamics, chemistry and working style. Having to work collaborating teammates was reassuring as it helps me understand that the team are more than willing to work together.
            <br>
            From there we worked on the inception deck to help us see what we wanted to do and tackle. I felt that the deck was useful as it helped the team to understand our product/ features.

            For week 3 we set up the Trello board, practice planning poker in class and created an excel sheet that stores attributes and table name.

          <br><br>
          <p>
            After setting up the trello board I felt the team can communicate better as we can see what are the things needed to be done and functions and features we can implement. This is helpful as the backend developers can start work on the user stories that are being stored in the product backlog, the front developers on the other hands would also know what are the pages to develop as each functions/ features are categorised based on the colours. We chose to use colours as a header to help us differentiate the features so that we know that the core features can be implemented before hackathon presentation.

          <br><br>
          <p>
            For the planning poker, we learened that as a team we may have differing oppinon on how big the scope of the project. Therefore, by using this game we can come to a middle ground where everyone would agree on the scope of the project. This is fair as the scope of the project are dependent on the skills of the developer and understanding of the user stories. Therefore by doing this game, the team can make sure that we all are on the same page.

          <p>
            For the Data dictionary I felt that it was useful in our planning stage. As the team would be able to disucss on what we need for the project and the logic of certain features. We spent a lot of time on this stage as we had a lot of conflict on how we should implement the features. During this stage I felt the team was going through the storming stage as we wasted a lot of time on small little issues. I also witnessed how each team member would react when conflict arises, from there I have applied what our school taught us and help everyone to come to a common ground where we all can see the bigger picture

          <p>
            This week was rather hectic and stressful as we focus purely on coding. During the coding process we had a lot of conflicts in the codes, as we were working on the front-end and back-end simultanously, there was bound to be alot of conflict as the backend would have to create the functions to redirect the page to the front-end.
            <br>
            We had to resolve it by active communication and whatsapp and discord was our main platformed we used to communicate. However, after the week I felt that the group has managed to make significant progress and I felt that we have moved from storming to norming. As we were able to understand each other better and our frequency has adjusted a long the way.

            Hackathon week has finally arrived and I felt that this week I struggled the most. Having to cope with assignments, development of the product and tutorials I felt that I was struggling to keep my head above the water.
            As our application was quite difficult to develop due to multiple factors, we spent a lot of time debugging and recreating the database. As the database wasn't able to sync hence we had to keep on notifying everyone of the changes we made and ensure updated their database.

          <p>
            Our team are grateful for the school for providing snacks and drinks while we were busy coding, I felt that the time spent during the hackathon was productive and everyone was busy doing their part in the project. At the end of the week, we had our presentation and I felt that it was passable though we made minor mistakes like not mentioning the 2nd stakeholder. I felt that we have managed to tackle the main issues of the project.
